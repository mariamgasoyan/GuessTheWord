# “Guess the word” game

1.Overview
My goal in the scope of this project is to build a “Guess The Word” game. The user needs to guess and imput the letters contained in  the hidden word considering the given hints and the number of needed letters (shown as dots). Each additional success adds points to the user’s account, while each failure takes some of the collected points away.

2.Target Users
-Who: Anyone, especially foreign speakers.
-What: A game.
-When: I would like to launch the game in 1.5 month.
-How: The users will be able to download the game from our Website.

3.User Problems Solved
User need: Users sometimes need a light and a mind training way to spend their free time. 
Resolution: The game allows the users not to spend their free time in vain keeping the brain in shape. 

User need: Foreign speakers need something to test their vocabulary knowledge.
Resolution: The game will contain many useful words to test the users’ vocabulary.
